Let's pretend we know about Ruby's [Enumerable](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Enumerable.html) module - that it's included in
Ruby's core collection classes like Array and Hash and provides a bunch of
methods for traversal, searching and sorting, and that we can can introduce it
to plain old ruby classes through inclusion and implementing the `#each` method.
Check out this [Enumerable primer](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/enumerables/) if you'd like a refresher.

[Enumerator](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Enumerator.html) is like `Enumerable's` kid sister; while `Enumerable` is getting all the attention, `Enumerator` should get more credit for doing amazing things in her own way. Well, it's time you took notice, Ma.

So what exactly is `Enumerator`? For one, it's a class. You can instantiate an
instance of `Enumerator` by calling certain `Enumerable` instance methods, like `Array#each`, without a block:

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].each
=> #<Enumerator: [1, 2, 3]:each>
```

In fact, you can do this for many (but not all) of Array's `Enumerable` methods
that expect a block:

```ruby
[1, 2, 3].map
=> #<Enumerator: [1, 2, 3]:map>

[1, 2, 3].select
=> #<Enumerator: [1, 2, 3]:select>

[1, 2, 3].reduce
LocalJumpError: no block given
```

Okay, big deal. What does this get us?

Instances of Enumerator are enumerable:

```ruby
e = [1, 2, 3].map
e.each { |n| p n }
1
2
3
=> [nil, nil, nil]
```

See what happened there? The expression printed out each digit, but returned `[nil, nil, nil]` instead of of `[1, 2, 3]`. The `Enumerator` implemented `map` in the context of `each`; since `p n` returns `nil`, we got three entries of `nil` in the return value. We chained the behavior of two enumerable methods.

It's often useful to enumerate collection members along
with the index. We can use `Enumerable#each_with_index`, but we don't have
`Enumerable#map_with_index`. JavaScript `forEach` and `map` gets this right, but not Ruby... or does it?

We can chain enumerators together to get effectively the same result:

```ruby
e = [1, 2, 3].map
e.each_with_index { |n, i| n * i }
=> [0, 2, 6]
```

The block receives each member of the original array along with its index
for each iteration. This usage is common enough, that `Enumerator` provides
`with_index` to give:

```ruby
e = [1, 2, 3].map.with_index { |n, i| n * i }
=> [0, 2, 6]
```

Reads pretty well. What's really interesting here is that enumerators package
up knowledge of a collection and a method with which we want to enumerate.

We can combine several enumerators in different orders to get different
behaviors. Here's an nice example borrowed from [another recent post on the subject](http://dgiim.github.io/blog/2015/08/24/ruby-enumerators/#the-enumerator-class):

```ruby
letters = %w[a b c d e]

group_1 = letters.reverse_each.group_by.each_with_index do |item, index|
  index % 3
end

group_2 = letters.reverse_each.each_with_index.group_by do |item, index|
  index % 3
end

p group_1
=> {0=>["e", "b"], 1=>["d", "a"], 2=>["c"]}

p group_2
=> {0=>[["e", 0], ["b", 3]], 1=>[["d", 1], ["a", 4]], 2=>[["c", 2]]}
```

`Enumerator` provides some additional methods that allow for "external"
enumeration as well. With an enumerator instance, we can call `next` to get each
successive member of the collection.

Consider `Enumerable#cycle`. Calling "cycle" on an enumerable collection (without a limit arg) will enumerate over members of a collection ad nauseum. When implemented as an enumerator of css colors, we can use `cycle` to create striped table rows:

```ruby
Project = Struct.new(:name)

colors = ['aliceblue', 'ghostwhite'].cycle
projects = [Project.new("TODO"),
            Project.new("Work"),
            Project.new("Home")]

require 'erb'

erb = (<<-ERB)
<table>
<% projects.each_with_index do |project, index| %>
 <tr style="background: <%= colors.next %>">
   <td><%= index + 1 %></td>
   <td><%= project.name %></td>
 </tr>
<% end %>
</table>
ERB

p ERB.new(erb).result(binding).gsub(/^$\n/, "")

=> '<table>
 <tr style="background: aliceblue">
   <td>1</td>
   <td>TODO</td>
 </tr>
 <tr style="background: ghostwhite">
   <td>2</td>
   <td>Work</td>
 </tr>
 <tr style="background: aliceblue">
   <td>3</td>
   <td>Home</td>
 </tr>
</table>'
```

Brilliant! Notice how, in each enumeration of `project`, we're calling `colors.next`. So external enumeration is one technique for enumerating more than one collection at a time.

Not all enumerators will enumerate forever. Using cycle with a limit will result
in a `StopIteration` error:

```ruby
numbers = [1,2].cycle(1)
=> #<Enumerator: [1, 2]:cycle(1)>

numbers.next
# => 1

numbers.next
=> 2

numbers.next
StopIteration: iteration reached an end
```

The `loop` construct knows how to rescues from this error and treats it as a
`break`:

```ruby
numbers = [1,2].cycle(1)
=> #<Enumerator: [1, 2]:cycle(1)>

loop do
  p numbers.next
end

puts "Tada!"

1
2
=> nil

Tada!
=> nil
```

We can rewind enumerators or peek at their next values:

```ruby
e = [1, 2, 3].each

e.next
=> 1

e.peek
=> 2

e.next
=> 2

e.rewind
=> #<Enumerator: [1, 2, 3]:each>

e.next
=> 1
```

So enumerators give us flexible and composable uses for enumerables. Combine them to extend behavior of existing enumerable methods. Use them for external enumeration with methods like `#next` and `#peek` for iterating over multiple arrays. In a future post, we'll take a look at how to create our own enumerators outside the context of arrays and hashes and some good reasons for doing so.

In case you missed it, [check out my presentation in the previous post](blog/ruby-enumerable.html) on the `Enumerable` module for more examples on how to get the most out of this terrific Ruby module.
