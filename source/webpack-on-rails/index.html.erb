  Frontend development with Rails these days is <span class="font-bold">hard</span>.
</section>
<section class="mb-8">
  <h3 class="mb-4">Why is this so difficult?</h3>
  <p class="mb-4">
    <span class="font-bold">Modular JavaScript is a dramatic shift in how we write and compile code.</span> Sure, life with the Rails asset pipeline was much simpler. With webpack, we cannot rely on global code execution by default as before.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    <span class="font-bold">Webpack configuration lacks the developer friendliness we know and love in Rails.</span> It's no secret, webpack is a capricious beast. Webpacker aims to reduce the overhead in getting up-and-running with webpack, but there's still some basics you're forced to learn.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    <span class="font-bold">The JS community moves at a fast pace making it difficult to keep up.</span> Babel, PostCSS, browserlist, React, Vue, Angular, Stimulus, webpack, node modules, NPM, yarn, argggghhhhh!!!
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    There's a lack of information for Rails developersâ€”<span class="font-bold">there's (currently) no official Rails guide for Webpacker!</span> No fear, I'm here to help fill the gap.

    My name is Ross Kaffenberger.
    I've been building web apps with JavaScript and Rails since 2007.
    Recently, I've spent a lot of time helping teams transition their Rails apps to the latest tools like React, Vue, and webpack.

  <p class="mb-4">
    I'm putting together resources to help Rails developers master modern frontend development with Rails, starting with <strong>The Webpacker Course</strong>.

    The Webpacker Survival Guide is broken into iterative modules, each building on the previous, to ensure you're covered from the basics to more advanced features. The course applies to Rails 4.2 through Rails 6.0 and Webpacker 4.0 through 6.0 (pending release).
