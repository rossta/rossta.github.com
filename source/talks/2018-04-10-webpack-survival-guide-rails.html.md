title: A Webpack Survival Guide for Rails Developers
author: Ross Kaffenberger
summary: In 2018, I worked on a project to migrate JavaScript asset bundling over from the Rails asset pipeline over to webpack alongside the Webpacker gem. This talk captures some of the mistakes we made, how we fixed them, and highlights general lessons to help Rails developers understand how webpack works and how it differs from its predecessor.
description: I set out to give the talk I would have wanted to see before making the switch from Sprockets to Webpacker in a large Rails application. This talk captures some of the mistakes we made, how we fixed them, and highlights general lessons to help Rails developers understand how webpack works and how it differs from its predecessor. RailsConf, Pittsburgh PA, April 2018.

I learned quite a bit (the hard way) helping my team switch our frontend JavaScript application [from the Rails asset pipeline to webpack](/blog/from-sprockets-to-webpack.html). I decided to distill what I learned into a talk I would have wanted to see before I started. This is that talk.
