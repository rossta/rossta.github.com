I spoke at a few local meetups recently to share what I look for when I interview junior developers for my tech team. I presented some fairly typical questions and dove into what I'm **really** hoping to find out, provided some takeaways to help guide answers.

I gave versions of this talk at [the CodeNewbie NYC meetup](https://www.meetup.com/CodeNewbie-NYC/events/235366882/) on November 18, 2016 and at [the CodeNewbie DC meetup](http://www.meetup.com/CodeNewbie-DC/events/235022354/) on November 29. In case you haven't heard about [CodeNewbies](http://www.codenewbie.org/) ([site](http://www.codenewbie.org), [twitter](https://twitter.com/CodeNewbies)), it's a super-supportive community of folks learning how to code. Check out the [local meetups](http://www.codenewbie.org/meetup-events) and the [popular podcast](http://www.codenewbie.org/podcast) hosted by [Saron Yibarek](https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek), where people share their stories about their coding journeys.

No matter how long I've been coding, I'll always think of myself as a CodeNewbie!
