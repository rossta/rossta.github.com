At some point we learned to walk, yet most of us find ourselves taking first steps time and again. Moving to another city. Going to a new school. Choosing a different career.

Over the past five years, I have done all these things: I moved to New York from Houston, started a Computer Science degree at NYU, and switched to a career in Software Engineering from Education. Starting anew has been at times difficult, occasionally impossible. It hasn’t always been fun and I’ve made my share of mistakes. And now I’m looking forward to sharing what I’ve learned.

Hello World.
