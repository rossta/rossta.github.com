Recent changes to the [`sprockets-rails`](https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails) gem now include a configuration option
to silence asset request logging in development.

### The problem

I love logs. Whenever someone comes to me with a Rails problem or we need to
debug something, the first question I'm thinking is, "What do the logs say?".

That said, sometimes Rails logs more info than we need. By default, Rails will record the web requests for each asset in development. Each page load could incur several to many additional requests for JavaScript, CSS, and images, potentially drowning your `STDOUT` or `development.log`.

As [this great article on Rails debugging with quiet logs points out](https://eliotsykes.com/quiet-assets), your log may get filled with lines like this:

```bash
Started GET "/assets/jquery.abcde.js?body=1" for 127.0.0.1 at 2016-08-27 18:38:00 -0400
...
```

Unless you're debugging an issue in the asset pipeline, numerous asset requests are not very useful and tend to mask more important info logged in the controller actions.

### Quieting assets, the old way

To disable asset logging behavior, many Rails 4 projects have used the `quiet_assets` gem.

So, why did we need a separate gem in the first place?

`Rails::Rack::Logger` is a middleware in the Rails middleware stack that logs all requests coming into your Rails app and implements an `ActiveSupport::Notification` for each request you can hook into for additional information. The `quiet_assets` gem simply sets the log level to `Logger::Error` for any request matching your application's assets path prefix, which means it won't show up in your log file or `STDOUT`.

The `quiet_assets` gem [monkeypatches `Rails::Rack::Logger`](https://github.com/evrone/quiet_assets/blob/e54ca548f005ca2a93e781c7b583ff4d0b59dd35/lib/quiet_assets.rb#L20) to accomplish this. Here's the relevant code provided in the gem:

```ruby
Rails::Rack::Logger.class_eval do
  def call_with_quiet_assets(env)
    begin
      if env['PATH_INFO'] =~ ASSETS_REGEX
        env[KEY] = Rails.logger.level
        Rails.logger.level = Logger::ERROR       # set the log level to silence
      end
      call_without_quiet_assets(env)
    ensure
      Rails.logger.level = env[KEY] if env[KEY]  # resets the previous log level
    end
  end
  alias_method_chain :call, :quiet_assets
end
```

While useful, it would be preferable to avoid monkeypatching the Rails logging
middleware and remove the `quiet_assets` dependency if `sprockets-rails` could
handle this for us.

### Replacing the quiet_assets gem

Now, as of the most recent version of `sprockets-rails` (at the time of this writing, version `3.1.1`) provides the ability to silence assets requests. This means the `quiet_assets` gem is no longer needed in a fresh Rails 5 application.

Here's how to configure your Rails app to silence asset logging with this most
recent version of `sprockets-rails`:

```ruby
# config/environments/development.rb

Rails.application.configure do

  config.assets.quiet = true

  # ...
end
```

So how does this work? The `sprockets-rails` gem now inserts an additional middleware ahead of `Rails::Rack::Logger` in the middleware stack:

```bash
$ bin/rake middleware
# ...
use Sprockets::Rails::QuietAssets
use Rails::Rack::Logger
# ...
```

When `config.assets.quiet` is enabled in development, the `Sprockets::Rails::Middleware` also matches on asset requests, but instead uses the `Rails.logger.silence { ... }` block method to change the log level to `Logger::ERROR`.

Here's a [link to the recent pull request](https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails/pull/355) if you're interested to take a closer look at how this functionality works. The entire middleware is [currently only 18 lines](https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails/blob/df5950017d7f2aa6fcbfa3949edfef85c35c28c7/lib/sprockets/rails/quiet_assets.rb):

```ruby
module Sprockets
  module Rails
    class QuietAssets
      def initialize(app)
        @app = app
        @assets_regex = %r(\A/{0,2}#{::Rails.application.config.assets.prefix})
      end

      def call(env)
        if env['PATH_INFO'] =~ @assets_regex
          ::Rails.logger.silence { @app.call(env) }  # silences the logs!
        else
          @app.call(env)
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Of course, this feature isn't just for Rails 5; it should also be possible for you to upgrade to this version of `sprockets-rails` for existing Rails 4 applications.

In case you're wondering, the `Rails.logger.silence { ... }` call assumes your
Rails logger includes the [`LoggerSilence` module](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/LoggerSilence.html), which adds the `#silence` method to the including logger class, which will set the log level to `Logger::ERROR` for the duration of the block, similar to how the `quiet_assets` gem works, but without monkeypatching.

### Logging to STDOUT

You may be surprised then to see asset requests fail if you're using a non-compliant logger. Unfortunately, this includes the `Logger` class from the Ruby standard library, which, of course, does not include the `LoggerSilence` module. You might be using Ruby's `Logger` if you've followed common recommendations to change your Rails logger to log to `STDOUT`, as in [this tutorial](http://blog.bigbinary.com/2016/04/12/rails-5-allows-to-send-log-to-stdout-via-environment-variable.html):

```ruby
config.logger = ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging.new(Logger.new(STDOUT))
```

I ran into this issue recently when assets were failing to load after I upgraded
to `sprockets-rails 3.1.1` and began seeing `NoMethodError: undefined method 'silence' for #<Logger:...>` in my development logs.

The fix is simple: to log to `STDOUT` and take advantage of the new
`Sprockets::Rails::QuietAssets` middleware, you could use `ActiveSupport::Logger` instead, which inherits from Ruby `Logger` and includes `LoggerSilence`:

```ruby
config.logger = ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging.new(ActiveSupport::Logger.new(STDOUT))
```

Alternatively, we could create our own subclass of `Logger` with `LoggerSilence`
included. If we just want `STDOUT` logging, we could instead use Heroku's
[`rails_stdout_logging`](https://github.com/heroku/rails_stdout_logging) gem,
which will also try to include the `LoggerSilence` module in our logger, if available.
