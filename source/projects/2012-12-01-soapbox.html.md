In August 2010, I created a simple in-browser PowerPoint-like application as an entry in the 10K Apart contest from [a list apart][10]. Contestants were challenged to use features of HTML5 to create front-end applications in less than 10K of code. Soapbox leverages HTML5 localStorage to save slides in stringified JSON for future use. Although my [my entry][11] didn’t win, it was a good experience to create something straightforward and useful under constraints and a tight timeline.
