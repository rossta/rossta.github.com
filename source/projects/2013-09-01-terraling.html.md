Professor Dennis Shasha at NYU recruited me to create a linguistics research tool. The vision is to provide a platform for linguists to make comparisons across a variety of attributes and properties of the worldâ€™s languages. Together with an undergrad developer, we built the site over a single semester and launched this past May, 2011. I continue to provide ongoing support.We devised a few database abstractions that would support a wide variety of use cases such as syntactic structures or phonetics. I engineered a multilevel search algorithm to filter results by a variety of potential inputs including linguistic properties, categories, keywords, parent and child relationships and examples.
