My friend Brenn got me into running not long after moving to New York. We’re both lifelong lovers of sport and we’ve shared many stories of athletic adventures and mishaps. [runningontilt](http://runningontilt.com) was born out of the desire to share our own sports stories with the world. I build, design and maintain the site, while Brenn does most of the podcasting. This site is formerly known as *turfcasts*.
