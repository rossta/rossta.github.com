My goal is to __help full stack web developers improve their JavaScript skills__ so that they can build better applications for their users. I'm especially interested in the intersection between __JavaScript and Ruby on Rails__.
Like many of you, I discovered the joy of programming late. I know how challenging it can be to learn this completely new way of thinking while dealing with LIFE.
